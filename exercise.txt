Process Documentation: Configuration of VLANs on Network Switches

Purpose: The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is to establish a comprehensive and standardized process for configuring VLANs on network switches within the technology company. This SOP aims to ensure the efficient and secure operation of the network infrastructure by providing a step-by-step guide for VLAN configuration.
Scope and Objectives: 
Scope: This SOP covers the configuration of VLANs on network switches and applies to all network engineers responsible for maintaining and optimizing the company's network.
Objectives:
1. Provide a systematic approach to VLAN configuration to enhance network performance.
2. Ensure consistency and standardization in VLAN setup across the network infrastructure.
3. Improve security by implementing VLANs to control and segregate network traffic.

Detailed Steps:
1. Gather Information:
* Collect details about the network topology, IP addressing, and VLAN requirements.
2. Access Switch Configuration:
* Log in to the network switch using appropriate credentials.
3. Enter Configuration Mode:
* Navigate to the configuration mode on the switch.
4. Create VLANs:
* Define VLANs based on gathered information.
5. Assign VLANs to Ports:
* Associate VLANs with specific switch ports.
6. Configure VLAN Interfaces:
* Set up virtual interfaces for each VLAN.
7. Verify Configuration:
* Confirm the successful configuration of VLANs using testing and verification tools.
8. Documentation:
* Update network documentation to reflect the changes made.
